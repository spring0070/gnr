## 以下是文章的主要重點：

This is a transcript of a stock market analysis show, where two analysts, Ed and Lexi, discuss various stocks and market trends. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Market Discussion**

* The market has been going sideways for some time now.
* Analysts are looking for stocks that can break out and lead the market higher.

**Stock Analysis**

1. **Delta Airlines**: The stock has pulled back to its 50-day moving average but is still holding above other key support levels. It may be a good buy opportunity.
2. **Apple**: The stock has been going sideways, but recent earnings acceleration makes it an attractive candidate for a breakout. A handle on the base could form soon.
3. **Google (Alphabet)**: The stock has pulled back to its 50-day moving average and is showing signs of recovery. Longer-term holders should be fine, but there may be some short-term decisions to make.
4. **Cisco Systems**: The company beat views and guided up a bit, but the guidance was mixed. This could lead to a pullback in the stock price.

**Earnings Discussion**

* Cisco Systems' earnings were generally positive, with some minor concerns about guidance.
* McDonald's reported good news, beating views, but their guidance is unclear.
* AppLovin has come under pressure due to the software sell-off and mixed guidance from the company.

**Closing Thoughts**

The analysts are looking for stocks that can break out of their current bases and lead the market higher. Some potential candidates include Apple, Delta Airlines, and Google (Alphabet). The market is expected to continue going sideways until a breakout occurs.
